## New Beginnings

Welcome to my website revamp and first ever blog!

## Plans

I intend to use this site as a continous project where I can cultivate and hone my skills as a developer. This blog will serve as one of several mediums for helping me accomplish this goal!

## Current Status

This website is still in development with regards to writing more posts and perfecting the CSS. Function over form any day. Please do check back often as I hope to have more posts soon!
