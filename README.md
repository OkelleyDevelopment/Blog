## Motivation

Having an interest in writing up my notes for others to see, I decided to utilize my skills that I have learned working
with React to rebuild my personal website and include a blog so that goal could be met!

## Future Goals

In no particular order I hope to have the following features:

- [x] Start Project by setting up a repository on GitHub
- [x] Add a Landing Page
- [x] Add a Contact Page
- [x] Add a About Page
- [x] Deploy!
- [x] Implement a Blog that displays articles
- [x] Write first article
- [] Add image to about page
- [] Review Graphql to add images to the Landing page (span the entire page)
- [] Shift away from CSS to SCSS or less?
- [] Add a form to the Contact Page
